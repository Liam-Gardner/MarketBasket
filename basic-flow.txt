1. User enters metabase login details

2. User enters storeId, confidence, rulesAmount, byItemName parameters

3. Upon succesful login user is redirected to getRules route

4. We send a SQL query to metabase to join the right tables so that we get a 2 column dataset back with an OrderId  column and an OrderItem column.

5. Metabse returns a .csv file with the dataset and we create a folder on the server using the storeId as its name as well as storing the dataset inside also using the storeId. {storeId}-data.csv

6. Next we pass the storeId, confidence, rulesAmount, byItemName parameters to a function that will invoke an instance of R.

7. The R script will firsty install the necessary pacakges for assoication rules and visualisation. ('arules', 'arulesViz', 'tidyverse', etc.)

8. We then group each order item under their relevant order id so that it can be stored as a transaction object. 

9. Now that it is in the correct format we can mine the data for association rules using the Apriori alogrithm.

10. Once the alogrithm is complete we return the data as a JSON object to our Node server.

11. We can now return the rules in JSON format to the client.
