1. Test in R studio with the names again

2. Why is the reduce function removing some rules? 
    - check if the key is the same, in which case the reduce function would be overwriting it
    - and do we really want 
        "burger" => "chips"
        "burger" => "fish"
    If they both have the same confidence how do we pick which one is more worthy? Lift? Find a way
